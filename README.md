# Intelligent Avatar


The idea is a super intelegent avatar that can fleuntly conversate with users.

The avatar is for the most part powered by OpenAI's technology. It uses whisper and ChatGPT models.

Short 2:30 minutes live working demo of only a Voice-to-voice convo with the avatar: https://youtu.be/a2JKVeLiWJk

The produced avatars presented in the presentation for the project are a product of movio.la studio. They provide an API a part of thier service as well traditional transactional means.

The intent of this project is to use a fixed set of a few in-house developed avatars. This is for the purpose of increasing the quality, cost cuts, and comptational efficiency.


Estimated time to complete is by end of summer with the right team and resources.
